## Vehicle detection in video data using yolo v8 
Vehicle detection in video streams has numerous uses, including traffic monitoring, cars for security surveillance. However, due to factors such as varying lighting conditions, vehicle orientations, conclusions, and complex backgrounds, conducting accurate and real-time vehicle detection from videos offers significant technical hurdles. Hand-crafted features in traditional computer vision algorithms limit their ability to handle such complicated circumstances. Deep learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently reached state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of visual identification tasks, including object detection. Real-time object detection skills suited for video analysis applications have been demonstrated by models such as YOLO (You Only Look Once). With some of the most recent developments in CNNs and object detection algorithms, we create and assess a deep learning-based system in this project for real-time car detection from video data. For quick and precise detection, we specifically implement a YOLOv8 model that integrates advancements from YOLOv3 and YOLOv4. Furthermore, to give geographical context that can aid in addressing issues like occlusions, we suggest combining a semantic segmentation branch with the detector.
